<----SUMMARY---->
On Posts Eatery it allows users from around the area to post they're favorite Restaurants and Activities! You can post the names, locations, average pricing, and even photo's! 
You can also leave reviews on your own posts and others to see what others think about they're exprience at said post! 

<----FUTURE PLANS----> 
I plan to add in a search bar on the google maps API so you can just copy and paste the location right then and there right on the home page!
Also to be able to allow users to post more than 1 photo at a time and a singular posting.
